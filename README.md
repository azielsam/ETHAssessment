# Creating a Token

In order to represent, share, and manage different digital assets or rights in a decentralized, secure, and transparent manner, a token is created on a blockchain. This enables a wide range of applications across industries.

## Description

Creating tokens on a blockchain involves setting up a smart contract with parameters like Token Name, Abbreviation, and Total Supply. To produce and distribute tokens, you will need a mint function, and to destroy them, a burn function. Importantly, the burn function has conditionals that check to see if the address has enough tokens to burn, maintaining supply integrity.
